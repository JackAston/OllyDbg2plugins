SystemTray plugin for OllyDBG v2.01d
by suburban_user


This simple plugin allows the main Olly2 window to be mimized and hidden, 
as well as restored.. from an icon in your system tray. 

Why..? 
Why not?!


USAGE:
-put "SystemTray.dll" in your Olly2 plugin directory
-start Olly2 and see your shiny new system tray icon!
-double click the icon to minimize/restore.
-right click the icon for a mimimize/restore context menu

-minimizing Olly2 directly will not mimize to the tray, this must be done from the tray icon itself!

ps; THIS PLUGIN WILL NOT FUNCTION CORRECTLY WITH OLLY2 INDEPENEDENT WINDOWS SETTING ENABLED! 
(Sorry but I don't personally use independent windows, so this bug does not bother me enough to code a fix at the moment.)

enjoy.
